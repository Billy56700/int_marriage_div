# International Marriage and Divorce Landspace and Trends in Taiwan (2021-2023)

## Project Description

[Enter a brief description of your project, including the data you used and the analytical methods you applied. Be sure to provide context for your project and explain why it is important.]

Over time, Taiwan's demographic landscape has shifted significantly with the addition of 570,000 new immigrants, including migrant workers and international marriages (Source: WEALTH MAGAZINE, 2022). Taiwan once had the highest rate of international marriage in Asia, comprising nearly 15.9% of all marriages (Source: Commonwealth Magazine and WEALTH MAGAZINE, 2022).

International marriages are crucial to Taiwan's demographic landscape. However, the trends in international marriages have been seldom discussed in recent years, particularly after the pandemic.

In this study, we aim to explore the evolving landscape and trends of international marriages in Taiwan. Specifically, we seek to address the following questions:

1. What is the overall landscape of international marriages in Taiwan?
2. What are the trends of international marriages among different nationalities in the post-pandemic years?
3. What are the gender dynamics of international marriages between major nationalities?
4.
